How to get the -real- last character typed in input with maxlength?


I wanted to know which character the user is typing into an input:

I have an input:

  <input maxlength="20"/>
and a script that returns the last typed char:

var eingabe;
$('form').on('keypress', function(event) {

    /// if no whitespace:
    if (String.fromCharCode(event.keyCode).replace(/\s/g, "").length > 0) {
    eingabe = String.fromCharCode(event.keyCode);
    $('#eingabe').html("<div>Eingabe : "+ eingabe +"</div>");
   }
});
My question is: because my input has a maxlength attribute, the last typed character on the keyboard is sometimes not the last -real- typed character into the input because the input is "full". How can I get the last character typed into the input?
